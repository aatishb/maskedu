    <h2>Who Does a Mask Protect?</h2>

    <p>
      Let’s imagine that a contagious person wears a 50% effective mask.
      By "50% effective" we mean that wearing this mask cuts in half the chance that this person will infect a nearby susceptible person.
    </p>

          In this scenario, the contagious person exhales through the mask. Since we assumed that the mask is 50% effective, disease transmission drops by 50%. We can see this in the simulation by noticing that about half the droplets make it through the barrier.

    <p>
      What if the <b>susceptible person wears the mask instead</b>?
    </p>

    <p>
      The effectiveness of a mask usually depends on whether you’re <b>inhaling</b> or <b>exhaling</b> through it.
      Let’s keep things simple and assume that masks are equally effective when we breathe in or breathe out through them.

        <p>
          In this scenario, the susceptible person inhales through the mask. Since we assumed the mask is equally effective on inhalation and exhalation, we still expect disease transmission to drop by 50%. We can see this in the simulation by noticing that about half the droplets make it through the barrier.

          How much will disease transmission drop in <span class="yellow"><b>Transmission Route 4</b></span>, when both people are wearing 50% effective masks? What evidence do you have?
          <span v-if="!expandaside3">(Click to expand)</span>
        </p> 
      </span>

      <span v-if="expandaside3">
        <p>
          The first mask cuts disease transmission in half, and the second mask also cuts the chance of infection in half. So when <i>both</i> people wear masks, disease transmission is halved twice, i.e. it is quartered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 50% × 50% = 25%, in this scenario disease transmission becomes 25%, which means the <b>drop in disease transmission</b> is 75%.
